            <p>Why cure stucco?</p>
  
            <i class="arrow"></i>
          </div>
  
          <div class="answer">
            <p>In order for stucco to achieve its optimal strength and durability and therefore go from a work-in-progress to a solid, finished surface, it needs to cure.  As stucco cures, its pH level falls and the surface can accept a finish coating. If the finish coating is applied to the stucco before its done curing, the finish coating can lose adhesion.</p>
